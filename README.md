User Story for Ranter

As a Karen, I want to be able to register for a ranter account so I can share or post my stories on a public page as well as sharing the content of other users. This webpage can be for anyone who has something they want to rant about and wants everyone else to know.  


## Technology Used:

### We utilized express app to render our html pages from ejs templates.
### Our restful routes utilized a 3 controller system that allowed us to create users with multiple posts and user authentication. 
### Mongodb was utilized to host our user posts and authorizing databases.
###Github was utilized so that all developers could proceed on their tasks and merge onto a final working product.
###Css was utilized for the styling of all pages.

### Getting the authorization controller to work correctly was a little tricky. Working with multi controllers with associations was tough but we made it through. Also, Github was also a little bit of a struggle to learn when it came to managing three developers and merging their data into one product.
